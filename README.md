### **Learning Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) with Java**

This repository is dedicated to my journey of learning **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** in **Java**. As I progress through the topics, Iâ€™ll be adding implementations, explanations, and notes for each data structure and algorithm I study. The goal is to build a solid understanding of DSA concepts and become proficient in problem-solving.

#### **What to Expect**
- **Java Implementations**: Each data structure and algorithm will be implemented in Java, following best practices.
- **Detailed Explanations**: I'll provide step-by-step breakdowns of how each data structure works and how algorithms solve specific problems.
- **Problem-Solving**: As I learn, I'll tackle coding problems related to each topic and include solutions with explanations.
- **Practice Problems**: Links to practice problems from platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, etc., to solidify my understanding.

#### **Topics Covered**
1. **Data Structures**:
   - Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues
   - Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees)
   - Graphs (Directed, Undirected, Weighted)
   - Hash Tables and Heaps

2. **Algorithms**:
   - Searching Algorithms (Binary Search, DFS, BFS)
   - Sorting Algorithms (Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Bubble Sort)
   - Dynamic Programming (Knapsack, Fibonacci)
   - Divide and Conquer (Merge Sort, Quick Sort)
   - Greedy Algorithms and Backtracking
